======================

Hello followers!

My name is Melissa. I am an entry-level programmer/web developer and I am learning the ropes here on GitHub! I like food, movies, scrapbooking, and Reddit. I also have an obsession for buying burp cloths and bows for my baby. It's a problem, but I'm working on it.
